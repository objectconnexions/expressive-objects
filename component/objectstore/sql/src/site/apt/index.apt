SQL ObjectStore

 The <sql> object store module provides the ability to persist 
 domain objects into an RDBMS.  It has no external dependencies, 
 using simply JDBC.

 For more information, see the 
 {{{./sql-impl/index.html}Implementation}}, 
 {{{./sql-tests-common/index.html}Common Tests}} and 
 {{{./sql-tests-served/index.html}Served Tests}}
 documentation.
 
 
Alternatives

  Alternatives include:
  
  * the {{{../dflt/index.html}dflt}} in-memory object store (for prototyping only)

  * the {{{../xml/index.html}XML}} object store

  * the {{{../nosql/index.html}NoSQL}} object store

 []
 
 Another more sophisticated but also more complex alternative has been implemented
 using JPA.  However, this is currently not part of Expressive Objects because it has a
 dependency on Hibernate (not compatible with the Apache license).  One
 option under consideration is to port JPA object store to use OpenJPA.
