Groovy Programming Model
 
 The <groovy progmodel> configures Expressive Objects to allow you to write your domain objects 
 in {{{http://groovy.codehaus.org}Groovy}}.
 
 The conventions are based on the <default programming> model; the purposes of this 
 programming model is to instruct Expressive Objects to ignore synthetic methods created by the
 Groovy compiler.
 
Alternatives

  Alternatives include:
  
  * the {{{../dflt/index.html}default}} programming model.
  
    For domain objects written with Java.

  * the {{{../wrapper/index.html}wrapper}} programming model.
  
    This extends the default programming model by providing the ability for domain objects to
    interact with each other <as if> through the user interface (that is, obeying any business
    rules that would otherwise be enforced at the application layer).

  []
  
  Note that these are <not> necessarily mutually exclusive (they can be combined).
