Security File Implementation
 
 The <file security> module is a simple implementation of ExpressiveObjects' authentication and
 authorization APIs, that uses flat files store user/passwords/roles (for authentication)
 and role-based permissions (for authorization).
 
 Because of critical information stored in flat files, this implementation is unlikely to 
 be suitable for deployment, but it is valuable both for prototyping and building
 up roles/permission sets (eg to be imported into some other implementation).  It is
 also useful as a example implementation that can be enhanced as required.
 
 See the security 
 {{{../docbkx/html/guide/expressive-objects-security.html}HTML}} or 
 {{{../docbkx/pdf/expressive-objects-security.pdf}PDF}} documentation for more detail.
 
Alternatives

  Alternatives include:
  
  * the {{{../dflt/index.html}default}} (no-op) security implementation, for prototyping use only

  * the {{{../ldap/index.html}LDAP}} security

  * the {{{../sql/index.html}SQL}} security (reading from simple SQL tables)
