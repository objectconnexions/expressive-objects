Security LDAP Implementation

 The <ldap security> module provides an implementation of ExpressiveObjects' authentication and
 authorization APIs where credentials are stored in a well-known LDAP server.
 
 This makes the LDAP security implementation suitable for deployment where an
 LDAP exists.  Optionally it may be combined with other implementations (for example
 the authorization might be performed using the file-based implementation).
 
 See the security 
 {{{../docbkx/html/guide/expressive-objects-security.html}HTML}} or 
 {{{../docbkx/pdf/expressive-objects-security.pdf}PDF}} documentation for more detail.
 
Alternatives

  Alternatives include:
  
  * the {{{../dflt/index.html}default}} (no-op) security implementation, for prototyping use only

  * the {{{../file/index.html}file-based}} security (reading from simple flat files)

  * the {{{../sql/index.html}SQL}} security (reading from simple SQL tables)
