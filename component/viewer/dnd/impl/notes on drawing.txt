## Notes on drawing

Drawing is relative to the top-left corner of a component, starting at
coordinates 0,0.

Some drawing methods (rectangles, ovals etc) have a position and a
size, some have multiple positions, while other have a single position
and known their own size.

#### Heights/widths vs positions

Because the drawing is based on lines with a width (typically a pixel)
the calculations for determining position can be non-obvious. If you
draw a rectangle at 0,0 with a height of 10 then to draw a line at the
same level as bottom edge then that line must have a y coordinate of
9. This is because the first line is on pixel row 0, the second on row
1 and so on. After 10 pixels - the height - you will reach the 9th
row.

The same applies for widths.

#### Aligning text

There are some helpers method to align text. The calculate the
baseline and the left-hand edge of the text give a particular style,
bounding area and the text. The methods are

* TextUtils.getBaseline(TextStyle, VerticalAlignment, y, height)
* TextUtils.align(TextStle, Alignment, x, width)

VerticalAligment is one of TOP, CENTER or BOTTOM and Alignment is one
of LEFT, CENTER or RIGHT.
