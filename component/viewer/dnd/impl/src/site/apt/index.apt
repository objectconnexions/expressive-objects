DnD Viewer

 The Drag and Drop (DnD) viewer is non-web graphical user interface that employs a 
 desktop metaphor for interacting with domain objects.  It renders each domain object 
 as an icon or a window and allows the user to manage and manipulate them using the mouse
 and keyboard. Dragging and dropping domain objects plays a major role in
 this interface, hence its name.
 
Customization

  The DnD viewer defines its own API to allow new views to be defined.  These can be for
  entities, for entity properties (and action parameters), for entity collections, and
  for collections of entities.
