HTML Viewer

 The HTML viewer provides a simple webapp interface for interacting with an Expressive Objects domain model.
  
 It renders each domain object or collection of domain objects as a web page, with
 hyperlinks used to navigate between objects.  In addition, object actions can also be invoked,
 with hyperlinks bringing up a page for action parameters if required.
 
Customization
 
  The HTML viewer offers only very limited customization opportunities; the CSS can be
  altered, but that's about it. 
 
Alternatives

  There are two other webapp viewers which provide more far wider customization opportunities:
  
  * the {{{../scimpi/index.html}Scimpi}} viewer uses a JSF-like markup metaphor
  
  * the {{{../wicket/index.html}Wicket}} viewer uses a {{{http://wicket.apache.org}Apache Wicket}} components
    (and allows you to define your own components also).
