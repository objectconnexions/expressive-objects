Support for viewer config files 

  The "Installer" architecture will automatically load configFiles, following 
  the convention "xxx_yyy.properties".  When run from uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.Expressive Objects or
  uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.WebServer, a "viewer installer" is also specified, meaning
  that a config file for this viewer is also loaded (eg viewer_html.properties).
  However, while ExpressiveObjectsWebAppBootstrapper uses the installer architecture for
  "back-end" components (security, persistor etc), it is not used for the viewers.
  
  Therefore, the ExpressiveObjectsWebAppBootstrapper will load additional config files for
  viewers if required, by searching for the "expressive-objects.viewers" context-param.
  
  For example:

     <context-param>
        <param-name>expressive-objects.viewers</param-name>
        <param-value>restful</param-value>
     </context-param>
