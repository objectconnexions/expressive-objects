RestfulObjects AppLib

  The <restfulobjects> viewer's <applib> module defines (among other things) the
  JAX-RS (JSR-311) compliant interfaces which define the URIs exposed by
  the viewer.  These do allow frameworks (such as JBoss' {{{http://jboss.org/resteasy}RestEasy}}
  framework) to generate client-side bindings.  

Further Info
  
  See this module's {{{./apidocs/index.html}Javadoc}} and the {{{../docbkx/html/guide/expressive-objects-restfulobjects-viewer.html}user guide}} for more information.
