RestfulObjects for ExpressiveObjects

 The <restfulobjects> viewer provides a RESTful interface to the domain object model,
 running over the HTTP protocol, and implemented as a webapp (servlet).
 
 Each domain object (or part of object) is exposed as a RESTful resource, in
 a JSON representation.

 The viewer is an implementation of the {{{http://restfulobjects.org}Restful Objects}}
 specification, intended to allow other server-side frameworks to be implemented
 to support the same protocol.
