/**
 * Provides a mechanism for providing a default value for an object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface is used in two complementary ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>As one option, it allows objects to take control of their own default
 * values, by implementing directly. However, the instance is used as a factory
 * for itself. The framework will instantiate an instance, invoke the
 * appropriate method method, and use the returned object. The instantiated
 * instance itself will be discarded.</li>
 * <li>Alternatively, an implementor of this interface can be nominated in the
 * {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.annotations.Defaulted} annotation, allowing a
 * class that needs to have a default to indicate where its default comes from.</li>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Whatever the class that implements this interface, it must also expose either
 * a <tt>public</tt> no-arg constructor, or (for implementations that also are
 * <tt>Facet</tt>s) a <tt>public</tt> constructor that accepts a single
 * <tt>FacetHolder</tt>. This constructor allows the framework to instantiate
 * the object reflectively.
 * 
 * @see Parser
