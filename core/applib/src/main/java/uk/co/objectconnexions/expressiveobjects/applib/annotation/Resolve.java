/**
 * Indicates that the resolving (loading from the datastore) of 
 * a property or collection should be performed lazily or eagerly.
 * 
 * <p>
 * By default, collections and reference properties are resolved
 * lazily, while value properties are resolved eagerly.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Using this annotation, an <tt>Order#lineItems</tt> collection might be
 * resolved eagerly.  A viewer might use this hint to &quot;open&quot; 
 * the collection automatically so that the user could see a list of
 * line items immediately when the order is rendered.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Or, a reference property containing an <tt>Address</tt> might be shown
 * address as an embedded property.
 *
 * <p>
 * Or, a value property might be annotated to resolve lazily; this would be
 * suitable for handling of BLOBs and CLOBs.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For properties and collections there is some similarity between this concept 
 * and that of eager-loading as supported by some object stores.  Indeed, some 
 * object stores may choose use their own specific annotations (eg a JDO default 
 * fetch group) in order to infer this semantic.
