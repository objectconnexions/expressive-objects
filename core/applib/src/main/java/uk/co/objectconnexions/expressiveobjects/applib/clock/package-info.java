/**
 * Defines a {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.clock.Clock} singleton
 * that can be used to obtain the current time.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All of the built-in value types relating to time have
 * {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.adapters.ValueSemanticsProvider#getDefaultsProvider() defaults}
 * that use the {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.clock.Clock} singleton.  For
 * consistency, domain objects and services should also use the Clock. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * Providing a clock is useful for testing, allowing the "current" time
 * to be placed under programmatic control (by {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.fixtures.FixtureClock#initialize() initializing}
 * a {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.fixtures.FixtureClock}.  Otherwise though
 * the {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.clock.Clock} just uses the time from the
 * current system.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note: this design also means that other {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.clock.Clock}
 * implementations - such as a one that accesses the time from an NNTP time
 * daemon - could also be used.
