 * This package contains adapter classes which can optionally be used for

 * {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.AbstractService domain services} and for
 * {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.AbstractFactoryAndRepository repositories}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition, it contains a {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.Identifier class}
 * that represents the identifier of an object or object member, used for
 * example in the <tt>events</tt> package as well as internally within the
 * framework.
