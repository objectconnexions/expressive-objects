/**
 * Domain object representing a particular perspective on the services or
 * objects available to a logged-in user.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The word "perspective" is used here in a similar sense to the Eclipse IDE,
 * meaning a configuration of objects. You might also think of it as the user's
 * desktop (though that metaphor only makes sense with the DnD viewer).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that this type is an interface, not a class. The actual implementation
 * is provided by the framework itself.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link Perspective}s go together with {@link Profile}s: a {@link Profile} is
 * a container of multiple {@link Perspective}s. As such, {@link Perspective}s
 * can be created from {@link Profile}s; {@link Profile}s themselves are created
 * using the {@link UserProfileFixture} can be used. Thereafter the @{link
 * Profile} and its {@link Perspective}s are stored in a <tt>profilestore</tt>
 * (analogous to an object store).
