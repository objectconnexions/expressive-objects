/**
 * Defines interfaces for domain objects that constitute the framework's
 * view of a &quot;user profile&quot;. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each user can hold a single {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.profiles.Profile},
 * which in turn can hold option settings (eg preferred colour theme) and 
 * {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.profiles.Perspective}s (a particular 
 * arrangement of the user interface; the terminology comes from the Eclipse
 * RCP/IDE platform).
 *  
 * <p>
 * The use and surfacing of these capabilities is dependent on the viewer;
 * most notably the drag-n-drop viewer does support the concept of a user
 * profile, but many others do not.
