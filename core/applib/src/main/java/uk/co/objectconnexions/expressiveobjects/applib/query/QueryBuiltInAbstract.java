/**
 * Although (through this class) the subclasses implements {@link Query} and
 * thus are meant to be {@link Serializable}, this isn't actually required of
 * the built-in queries because they are all converted into corresponding
 * <tt>PersistenceQuery</tt> in the runtime for remoting purposes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The principle reason for this is to reduce the size of the API from the
 * {@link DomainObjectContainer} to <tt>RuntimeContext</tt>. It also means that the
 * requirements for writing an object store are more easily expressed: support
 * the three built-in queries, plus any others.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note also that the {@link QueryFindByPattern} isn't actually serializable
 * (because it references an arbitrary pojo).
 * 
 * <p>
 * REVIEW: now that we've dropped remoting, could we get rid of the <tt>PersistenceQuery</tt>
 * classes and just use these classes throughout?
