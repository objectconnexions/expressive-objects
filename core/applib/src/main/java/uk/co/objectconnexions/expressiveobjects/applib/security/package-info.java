/**
 * This package defines types that represent the 
 * currently logged-in {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.security.UserMemento user}
 * and their {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.security.RoleMemento role}s.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Typically domain objects do not need to have any knowledge of <i>who</i>
 * is using them, because authorization is provided declaratively by the
 * framework and is type-based.  However, there are occasions; for example,
 * only an <tt>Employee</tt> and his superiors might be allowed to view their salary.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The types are suffixed &quot;Memento&quot; because they snapshot the user
 * and roles at the time that the user logs in, but are not updated after that 
 * point.
