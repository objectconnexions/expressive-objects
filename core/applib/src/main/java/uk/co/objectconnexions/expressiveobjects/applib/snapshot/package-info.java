/**
 * This package defines a marker {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.snapshot.Snapshottable interface}
 * that indicates that the implementing domain object can be &quot;snapshotted&quot;
 * into an XML format using a utility class provided by the framework.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The extent of the data within the XML snapshot can be controlled programmatically,
 * typically by the object creating the snapshot.  If the responsibility for knowing
 * what should go into the XML is actually in the 
 * {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.snapshot.Snapshottable}
 * domain object itself, then the {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.snapshot.SnapshottableWithInclusions}
 * interface can be used instead.
 *
 * <p>
 * The utility class that is used to create the snapshot is called 
 * <tt>XmlSnapshot</tt>, and resides within the <tt>core.runtime</tt> module.  
 * Best practice is to define a <tt>SnapshotService</tt>
 * interface as a domain service, and whose implementation will delegate to the
 * <tt>XmlSnapshot</tt>.  This approach ensures that the domain objects do not 
 * have any coupling to the framework.
