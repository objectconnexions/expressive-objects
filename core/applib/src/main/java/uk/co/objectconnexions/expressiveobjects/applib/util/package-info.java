/**
 * This package defines a small number of utility classes for
 * generating {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.util.TitleBuffer title}s for 
 * domain objects and for generating
 * {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.util.ReasonBuffer reason}s (why a 
 * class member is disabled or a proposed value invalid).
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is an implementation of the DDD &quot;Specification&quot;, allowing
 * validatation that might otherwise be repeated for both properties and
 * parameters (in the <tt>validateXxx()</tt> methods to be factored out.
 * 
 * <p>
 * That said, there is still some repetition in that the {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.annotation.MustSatisfy}
 * annotation must be applied in all appropriate cases.  If it is the case that
 * the validation rules would apply <i>every</i> case, then it is generally 
 * preferable to implement a {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.annotation.Value} type
 * through the {@link uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib.adapters.ValueSemanticsProvider}
 * interface.
