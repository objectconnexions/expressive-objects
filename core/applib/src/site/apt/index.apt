Application Library
 
 <Expressive Objects> works using convention-over-configuration; you write
 your domain objects following a set of conventions, and these are interpreted
 by the framework in order to render, persist, remote or otherwise interact
 with your domain model.
 
 These conventions are together known as the <Expressive Objects Programming Model>.
 The <Expressive Objects Application Library> - or AppLib - constitutes those elements
 of the programming model that are declarative (such as annotations and 
 interfaces).  It also contains the <<<DomainObjectContainer>>> interface, 
 which is normally injected into your domain objects and represents the
 only point of coupling from your domain into the framework. 
 
 See the AppLib guide ({{{./docbkx/html/guide/expressive-objects-applib.html}HTML}}
 or {{{./docbkx/pdf/expressive-objects-applib.pdf}PDF}}) for further details.
