/**
 * Indicates that this class is parented, that is, wholly contained within a
 * larger object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are two classes of object that are parented:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Aggregated objects</li>
 * <li>Internal collections</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In the standard Expressive Objects Programming Model, aggregated objects typically corresponds to
 * applying the <tt>@Aggregated</tt> annotation at the class level.  
 * In terms of an analogy, aggregated is similar to Hibernate's component types
 * (for larger mutable in-line objects) or to Hibernate's user-defined types
 * (for smaller immutable values).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Internal collections are the {@link List}s, {@link Set}s etc that hold references to
 * other root entities.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The object may or may not be {@link ImmutableFacet immutable}.  If an aggregated entity, then it may
 * reference regular entity domain objects or other aggregated objects.
