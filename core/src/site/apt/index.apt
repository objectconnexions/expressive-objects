Core Framework
 
  The <core> module is the parent of a set of submodules that collectively 
  form the core of Expressive Objects.
  Specifically, they provide:

  * JUnit/JMock {{{./testsupport/index.html}testing support}}

  * {{{./commons/index.html}common}} utilities
 
  * a {{{./metamodel/index.html}metamodel}} for domain models

  * reusable {{{./progmodel/index.html}programming model}} elements

  * reusable {{{./runtime/index.html}runtime}} elements (common across any runtime implementation)

  * reusable {{{./webapp/index.html}webapp}} servlets and filters (common across any web-based viewer implementations)

  []
  
  Across these modules a number of APIs are defined:  
  
  * persistence / entity lifecycle management ({{{../runtimes/index.html}runtimes}} API)  

  * authentication and authorization ({{{../security/index.html}security}} API)
   
  * programming model definitions ({{{../progmodels/index.html}progmodel}} API)
