/**
 * A <code>JUnitRuleMockery</code> is a JUnit Rule that manages JMock
 * expectations and allowances, and asserts that expectations have been met
 * after each test has finished. To use it, add a field to the test class (note
 * that you don't have to specify <code>@RunWith(JMock.class)</code> any more).
 * For example,
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class ATestWithSatisfiedExpectations {
 *     &#064;Rule
 *     public final JUnitRuleMockery context = new JUnitRuleMockery();
 *     private final Runnable runnable = context.mock(Runnable.class);
 * 
 *     &#064;Test
 *     public void doesSatisfyExpectations() {
 *         context.checking(new Expectations() {
 *             {
 *                 oneOf(runnable).run();
 *             }
 *         });
 * 
 *         runnable.run();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note that the Rule field must be declared public and as a
 * <code>JUnitRuleMockery</code> (not a <code>Mockery</code>) for JUnit to
 * recognise it, as it's checked statically.
