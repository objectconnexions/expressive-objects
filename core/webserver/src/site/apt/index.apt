WebServer (Jetty)
 
 The <webserver> module is intended to make it easy to run webapp-based viewers,
 using the webapp as defined in <<<src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml>>>.
 
 This is a useful facility to have during development, but is not (expected to 
 be) needed for deployment.   
 
 In essence all the module does is to bundle up 
 {{{http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/}Jetty}}.  An alternative would be to 
 use <<<mvn jetty:run>>>; this module is for when you'd rather just run a
 standalone program (ie, with a <<<main()>>> in it) without the overhead of
 Maven.
