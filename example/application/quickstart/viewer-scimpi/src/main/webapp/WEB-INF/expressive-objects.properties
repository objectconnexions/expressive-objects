# configure the persistor (object store) to use
#
# * in-memory   requires no additional configuration, but stores object in-memory.
#               Only suitable for prototyping
# * datanucleus uses JDO DataNucleus to persist objects to relational database.
#               for objectstore-specific properties, see persistor_datanucleus.properties   
# * fileserver  uses a simple FileServer to persist objects as JSON documents.  It requires the fileserver component to be running
#               for objectstore-specific properties, see persistor_fileserver.properties 
# * mongodb     uses MongoDB to be persist objects as JSON documents.  It requires MongoDB to be installed and running
#               for objectstore-specific properties, see persistor_fileserver.properties  
# * sql         uses an RDBMS to persist objects as table rows.  
#               for objectstore-specific properties, see persistor_sql.properties
# * xml         uses the XML ObjectStore to be persist objects to a set of XML files.  Only suitable for prototyping.
#               for objectstore-specific properties, see persistor_xml.properties 
#
# NOTE:
# * if using non-naive implementations of services, edit expressive-objects.services (below) and 
# * if necessary, update the pom.xml to reference appropriate objstore-xxx module
# * for sql and datanucleus objectstores, update the pom.xml to reference appropriate JDBC driver
