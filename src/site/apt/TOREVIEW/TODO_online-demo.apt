Online Demo

 You can try out [[NAME]] from a users' viewpoint by trying out the expenses app 
 that ships as an example with [[NAME]].  This is the same application that is shown in
 {{{./expenses-movies.html}movies}}.

[./images/demo-expenses.png] Expenses Application
 
 The app is deployed to run with the {{{./plugins/html-viewer/index.html}HTML Viewer}}, and you can logon {{{http://demo.expressiveobjects.apache.org/expenses/}here}}.  
 Log in with a user name of 'sven', or 'bob', or 'dick'; the password in all cases is 'pass'.
 
 []
 
 Like all [[NAME]] apps, the UI layer is generated directly from the domain objects; there is no
 presentation code.  The app itself is part of the {{{./downloads.html}downloads}}, or you might want to browse the 
 {{{https://apache.expressiveobjects.svn/svnroot/trunk/distribution/examples/expenses/dom/src/main/java/uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects/example/expenses/}source code}} directly.
