Dynamically Generated Presentation Layer

 If you deploy your domain model on ExpressiveObjects, then you have it
 dynamically generate either a RESTful back-end for your domain object model, 
 or to dynamically generate a webapp.
 
 This webapp is a great developers' tool, allowing you to explore your
 RESTful API without having to use other tools.
 
 You might also want to deploy this webapp directly for use by end-users.   
 The UIs generated by <Expressive Objects> are especially suitable to "expert" users, 
 typically those internal to your organization who have a good understanding 
 of the domain and just want to get their job done.
 
 For less expert users (or for a webapp deployed on the internet), we recommend
 that you develop a custom UI.  You could either have it call back to the RESTful API,
 or you could simply take your object model and use it as the domain layer witihn
 your preferred runtime framework.
