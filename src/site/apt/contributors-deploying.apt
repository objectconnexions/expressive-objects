Deploying Expressive Objects

  These notes are for Expressive Objects contributors with responsibility for 
  deploying Expressive Objects (either the code artifact via <<<mvn deploy>>> or the site via <<<mvn site-deploy>>>).
  
  NOTE: plan is to move this content into the DocBook "contributors' guide"

Prereqs

  The instructions given here assume you are running on a UNIX type machine.
  If you instead use Windows, then we recommend that you install
  {{{http://cygwin.com}Cygwin}}, to access a UNIX shell and the required 
  UNIX commands.
  
  When installing Cygwin, we also recommend that you select a couple of 
  additional utilities over and above the defaults:
  
  * shells group > chere utility
  
    This can be used to set up a "Bash prompt here" menu item from the 
    Windows Explorer context menu 
    
  * net group > openssh utility
  
    This provides the ssh client program, used for remoting into hosts securely
    (needed when uploading generated documentation)

  * net group > rsync utility
  
    This is used to actually upload generated documentation

  []

  When cygwin has installed, start a Cygwin Bash Shell as administrator 
  (press ctrl+shift), and then run:
  
+-------------------------------------------------------+
chere -i
+-------------------------------------------------------+

  Switch back to Windows Explorer and you'll find that you should be able to 
  start a bash shell in a new terminal window from any folder. 
   
Process

  For now, we'll just refer to the wiki documentation:
  
  * {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/EXPRESSIVE_OBJECTS/ManualDeployProcessForSnapshots}Manual deploy process for snapshots}}
  
  * {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/EXPRESSIVE_OBJECTS/ManualDeployProcessForSite}Manual deploy process for sites}}
  
  []
  
  The {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/EXPRESSIVE_OBJECTS/Index}Expressive Objects wiki}} 
  also documents a number of other processes.  These will be formalized 
  into documentation when they are proven and stable.
