Icons

  All <Expressive Objects> viewers allow icons to be associated with domain
  objects, typically a different icon for each entity type.
 
  We provide three different icon sets that you are free to use in your 
  own applications.

  * icons donated by Dan Haywood (download
    {{{./images/icons/haywood.zip}zip}})

  * icons developed by the 
    {{{http://tango.freedesktop.org/}Tango Desktop Project}}, released 
    to the public domain (download {{{./images/icons/tango.zip}zip}})

  * icons donated by the Naked Objects Group Ltd (download 
    {{{./images/icons/nogl.zip}zip}})
 
  []

  You can either download the ZIPs, or simply download individual icons
  directly from this page.
