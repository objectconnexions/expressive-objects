  We've developed a few simple utilities to help speed up your coding efforts. 
 
Eclipse

* Java Editor Templates

 Download the following links to a temporary directory:

 * {{{./ide/eclipse/templates/expressive-objects-templates.xml}expressive-objects-templates.xml}}

 * {{{./ide/eclipse/templates/junit4-templates.xml}junit4-templates.xml}}

 * {{{./ide/eclipse/templates/jmock2-templates.xml}jmock2-templates.xml}}

 []
  
 Now, import using <<Windows > Preferences > Java > Editor > Templates>> and then choose <<Import>>
 
 The Expressive Objects templates are prefixed <<<is>>>, the JUnit templates are prefixed <<<ju4>>>, and the JMock templates prefixed <<<jm2>>>.
 

* Code Folding

  The Expressive Objects code templates that we ship are designed to be used with the Coffee Bytes code folder, with <<<\{\{>>> and 
  <<<\}\}>>> being used to define custom regions.
  
  Unfortunately, though the original code-folding plugin stopped working somewhere around Eclipse 3.3.  
  All is not lost though; Kevin Meyer has helpfully recompiled it against Eclipse 3.5 (tested through to Eclipse 3.7).
  To use it:
  
  * download this {{{./com.cb.eclipse.folding.KAM-3.5.zip}zip}}
  
  * unzip into Eclipse's plugins folder
  
  * restart Eclipse
  
  []
  
  Then, use <<Windows > Preferences > Java > Editor > Folding>> and specify user-defined regions.

* Other Plugins

  The {{{./docbkx/html/guide/ch01.html}Contributors Guide}} also has suggestions for a number of other plugins
  that you might wish to use.
  
IntelliJ IDEA

 If your preferred IDE is IntelliJ Idea, then you can use the {{{http://code.google.com/p/eclipse2idea/}eclipse2idea}} project to
 convert the above Eclipse templates into IDEA's own templates.  Thanks to Alexander Krasnukhin for putting this together.
 

Other Tooling

  In the future we hope to revive some Eclipse plugins that was worked on a few 
  years ago, making it easy to apply annotations for example, or refactor 
  methods <and> their supporting methods.
  
  Another tool on the roadmap is a Maven plugin to allow metamodel validators
  to be run.  For example, this might allow orphaned supporting methods to be 
  identified.
