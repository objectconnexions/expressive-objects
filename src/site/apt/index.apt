 <Expressive Objects> is a framework to let you rapidly develop domain-driven 
 apps in Java.  It defines a clean programming model, has BDD and JUnit
 testing support, and can dynamically (at runtime) generate a representation 
 of that domain model using various presentation technologies.
 
 You can use Expressive Objects in a variety of ways, from initial prototyping
 all the way through to final deployment:

Expressive Objects in action
  
  We've deployed a {{{http://mmyco.co.uk:8180/expressive-objects-onlinedemo}simple demo app}}, so you can see 
  Expressive Objects in action.  The app is deployed with both the RESTful web service and the
  auto-generated webapp, running against an in-memory object store.  To use, you'll need to
  register an account (the credentials are stored only in memory and are reset nightly).
  
  The webapp has full documentation to guide you further.  It also links to the 
  {{{http://mmyco.co.uk:8180/expressive-objects-onlinedemo/doc/xref/index.html}application's source}} 
  so you can see how little code you need to write to get an application up and running with ExpressiveObjects.
  
Getting Started
 
  Expressive Objects is built with Maven and has a {{{./quick-start.html}quickstart archetype}} 
  to get you going quickly.  This will generate a simple one-class domain model, configured
  to run like the online demo (but with no security).
  
  After that, please consult the various resources linked from the site menu on the left-hand side. 

Disclaimer
  
  <Expressive Objects> is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), 
  sponsored by the Incubator project. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
  until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision 
  making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
  While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability 
  of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.>
