For 'Newbie' Contributors
  
  All the projects in Apache - Expressive Objects included - only succeed because of the involvement 
  of their community:
  
  * For most, that means just using the software, and perhaps reporting the occasional
    feature request or defect via JIRA.
  
  * For some, it may also mean blogging or tweeting about using the software, explaining
    to others (or maybe themselves) about how it solves their particular problems, and
    in general helping to advertise its existence.
    
  * And finally there are the contributors to the project: those who have a deep belief 
    in the value of the software, and want to bring their expertise to bear to in its
    continued development.
  
  []
  
  So, suppose you find yourself in this latter group: you'd like to contribute back to 
  ExpressiveObjects, but you're not sure how.  On the one hand, there's knowing what the process is;
  on the other, there's just the difficulty of getting to grips with a large codebase.
  
Process

  From a process viewpoint, the way it works is:
  
  * make sure you are subscribed to the expressive-objects-users mailing list and to the expressive-objects-dev mailing list
  
    ... and start contributing to the conversation threads
    
  * register yourself on Apache's {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira}JIRA}} ticket tracking system
 
  * start contributing patches to existing JIRA issues
  
  * or, if you have some existing code that you think would be of value to the project,
    raise a new ticket and attach that code (eg as a zip)
    
  []
  
  After a little while, you may be invited to become a committer.  Someone in the existing
  community will ask you if you are interested; if you are, then a vote will be held by the
  existing committers and project mentors.  Assuming that it passes, you'll be granted
  permission to start committing directly to the source code repository.
  
JIRA tickets for 'Newbies'  
  
  As noted above, ExpressiveObjects' codebase is quite large, so navigating it and finding existing issues
  that could you could tackle can be quite a challenge.  To help, we've try to identify
  simple issues with a #newbie label.  These issues fall into one of two categories:
  
  * either they are really relatively trivial to complete
  
  * or, they represent stand-alone or new features that could be developed without necessarily
  having to grok all the existing code.

  You can find the current newbie issues by {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=12318871}following this link}}.  

  And, before you start, don't forget to consult the {{{./docbkx/html/guide/expressive-objects-contributors-guide.html}contributors guide}}
  to describe how to build Expressive Objects from source, and how to configure your development environment.    

Not only code  
  
  There are more ways to contribute than to cut code!  We'd also appreciate help with:
  
  * improving documentation (from fixing typos thru to writing how-to guides)
  
  * screencasts
  
  * developing example apps
  
  * writing blog posts
  
  * writing articles
  
  * taking part in mailing list discussions
