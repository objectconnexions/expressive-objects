Deploy <ExpressiveObjects> domain model on your own Framework

  The {{{../applib/index.html}programming model}} defined by Expressive Objects deliberately minimizes
  the dependencies on the rest of the framework.  In fact, the only hard dependency
  that the domain model classes have on Expressive Objects is through the <<<uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects.applib>>> 
  classes, mostly to pick up annotations such as {{{../applib/xref/uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects/applib/annotation/Disabled.html}@Disabled}}.  
  The idea is to make it easy to be able to write take a domain object {{{./develop.html}prototyped}} 
  and/or {{{./specify-and-test.html}tested}} using ExpressiveObjects, but to deploy on some
  other framework's runtime.
  
  If you are interested in taking this approach, note that there is one important
  interface that must be implemented by your own framework, namely
  {{{../applib/xref/uk.co.objectconnexions.expressiveobjects/applib/DomainObjectContainer.html}DomainObjectContainer}}.  
  This interface represents the one-and-only "touchpoint" between the domain objects and the runtime.
  If you inspect the methods then you'll see it covers such concerns as persistence, and of
  raising warnings or errors.
  
  ExpressiveObjects' own runtime injects an (implementation of this) interface into each and every domain
  object.  You will likely need to do something similar within your own framework, (or come up with an equivalent
  mechanism, eg Service Locator pattern).
  
  Note also that although Expressive Objects does define a convenience superclass <<<AbstractDomainObject>>>, 
  isn't necessary for domain objects to inherit from it.  In fact, the main purpose of this superclass
  is to provide delegate methods to the injected <<<DomainObjectContainer>>>.
  
* {Custom UI}

  One of the main reasons for going down the custom framework route is to have full control over the
  user interface, but it does beg the question: why bother with Expressive Objects at all?
  
  The answer is that using Expressive Objects to write your domain objects will: 
  
  * allow you to build a better/richer/deeper domain model more quickly.
    
    The key to better domain models is stakeholder feedback.  You can use Expressive Objects to spike out prototypes, and 
    then feedback the results of the insights gained from those prototypes into more formal development 
    in your actual runtime framework. 
  
  * enforce proper architectural layering.
  
    Expressive Objects only lets business logic to be written in domain objects.  Using Expressive Objects for your domain model 
    helps prevent business logic creeping into adjacent layers.

  That said, it is also possible to deploy Expressive Objects as a {{{./deploy-as-rest.html}REST webservice}}, so you
  could choose to implement a custom UI (eg in HTML5) that calls back to an Expressive Objects backend. 
  
* {Custom persistence}

  Another reason for choosing the custom framework is full control over persistence.  That is, you can
  use whichever persistence technology you prefer, not just those that have been integrated by ExpressiveObjects.
  
  That said, Expressive Objects has a pluggable persistence API, so you could integrate to some other persistence
  mechanism by implementing to this API.
  
* Embedded Runtime

  Even if you choose to deploy on your own framework, you may want to explore ExpressiveObjects
  {{{../runtimes/embedded/index.html}Embedded Runtime}} module. This allows the Expressive Objects metamodel to be
  instantiated standalone from the rest of the framework.  Using this you could, for example, roll-your-own
  generic UI; or you could integrate with other UI frameworks (such as {{{http://metawidget.org}MetaWidget}})
  that do a lot of the heavy lifting for you.
